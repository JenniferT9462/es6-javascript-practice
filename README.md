# JavaScript ES6 Exercises Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of JavaScript ES6 exercises designed to help learners practice various modern JavaScript features. Each exercise set focuses on a specific ES6 feature, with examples and problems for you to solve. The repository aims to provide practical, hands-on learning for improving JavaScript skills.

## Exercise Topics
The repository is organized into separate files for each ES6 topic, which include:

1. **Arrow Functions**: Learn how to write concise and powerful functions using ES6 arrow syntax. [Learn more](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrow_function.asp)
2. **Template Literals**: Practice string interpolation and multi-line strings with template literals. [Learn more](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_templates.asp)
3. **Default Parameters**: Use default values for function parameters to make your code more robust. [Learn more](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_parameters.asp)
4. **Destructuring**: Extract values from arrays and objects using destructuring assignments. [Learn more](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_destructuring.asp)
5. **Spread and Rest Operators**: Expand or collect elements with the spread and rest operators. [Learn more](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp#js_es6_rest)
6. **Promises**: Understand and practice working with Promises for handling asynchronous operations. [Learn more](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_promise.asp)
7. **Async/Await**: Simplify asynchronous code with async/await syntax while using the PokeAPI. [Learn more](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_async.asp)
